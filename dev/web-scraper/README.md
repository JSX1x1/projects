## Overview

This tool is designed for ethical hackers, security testers, and web scraping enthusiasts. It allows users to scrape website data and analyze it for malicious content, such as phishing attempts, spam, or dangerous scripts. It is essential to use this tool ethically and within the boundaries of legal frameworks.

## Features

- Scrapes websites for titles, links, paragraphs, and images.
- Detects malicious content like spam links and harmful JavaScript.
- Allows saving the scraped data to a CSV file.
- Checks for robots.txt to ensure compliance with the website’s scraping policies.

## Legal Disclaimer

## Python Version Setup

### Dependencies

To run the Python version of this scraper, you need to install the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x** (preferably Python 3.8 or newer)
- **pip**: Python’s package installer
- **Selenium**: To interact with dynamic web pages that load JavaScript
- **BeautifulSoup4**: To parse HTML
- **requests**: To make HTTP requests
- **PyQt6**: For the graphical user interface (GUI)
- **chromedriver**: Required for Selenium to work with Chrome

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Python 3.x**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check if Python is installed by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   If it's not installed, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install the necessary Python packages. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and then install the following dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests pyqt6
   ```

3. **Install ChromeDriver**:
   - Download the ChromeDriver that matches your version of Google Chrome from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
   - Extract the `chromedriver` executable to a location on your system (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/` on macOS/Linux or `C:\chromedriver\` on Windows).

4. **Ensure Chrome is Installed**:
   Chrome is required for Selenium to work. Make sure you have it installed. You can download Chrome from [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

5. **Test the Setup**:
   Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed by running the following Python code to check Selenium and ChromeDriver:

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver
   from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
   from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

   chrome_options = Options()
   chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service('/path/to/chromedriver'), options=chrome_options)
   driver.get("https://www.google.com")
   print(driver.title)
   driver.quit()
   ```

### Running the Python Application

1. **Run the Application**:
   Once the setup is complete, run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

2. **Use the GUI**:
   The application will launch a window where you can input the URL you want to scrape, click "Scrape Website" to retrieve data, and save the results to a CSV file.

## C++ Version Setup

### Dependencies

To run the C++ version of this scraper, you'll need the following libraries:

- **Qt**: To create the GUI (Qt5 or Qt6)
- **libcurl**: For making HTTP requests
- **Gumbo**: To parse the HTML content

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Qt**:
   - Download and install **Qt** from [the Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download). You can also use **Qt Creator** for easier project management.
   - Ensure Qt is correctly installed and set up in your development environment.

2. **Install libcurl**:
   - **Linux**: Use the following command to install libcurl:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
     ```
   - **Windows**: Download **libcurl** from [here](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Install Gumbo**:
   - Download Gumbo from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser).
   - Follow the instructions in the repository to build and install Gumbo on your system.

4. **Set Up the C++ Project**:
   - Open Qt Creator (or your preferred IDE) and create a new C++ project.
   - Link the project with **libcurl** and **Gumbo** by configuring the include and library paths in your `.pro` file or project settings.

### Running the C++ Application

1. **Build the Project**:
   After setting up the project, build the C++ application using your IDE or run the following command in your terminal if using `qmake`:
   
   ```bash
   qmake && make
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Once the project is compiled successfully, run the application from your IDE or terminal:

   ```bash
   ./webscraper
   ```

3. **Use the GUI**:
   The C++ version provides a GUI similar to the Python version. You can input the URL to scrape, click "Scrape Website", and save the results to a CSV file.

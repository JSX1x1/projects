## **📌 How to Use the Utils**  

### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies (If Required)**  
Most tools work **out of the box**, but if a tool requires dependencies, install them using:

### **2️⃣ Running a Tool**  
Each tool is either a **CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool** or a **GUI (Graphical User Interface) tool**.  

#### **🖥️ Running a GUI Tool**  
GUI tools provide a user-friendly interface. To launch one, simply run:  
```sh
python tool_name.py
```
Example:  
```sh
python file_compressor_GUI.py
```

#### **⌨️ Running a CLI Tool**  
CLI tools run directly in the terminal and often accept parameters.  
To see usage instructions, run:  
```sh
python tool_name.py --help
```
Example:

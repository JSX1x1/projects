# **4️⃣ How to Use the Tool (Step-by-Step Guide)**  

### **1️⃣ Open the Application**  
- If running **without admin privileges**, some features will be **disabled** for security reasons.  
- If running **as an admin**, full access is granted.  

---

### **2️⃣ Select a Disk**  
- The tool will **list all available disks**.  
- Click on a disk to **view its health status and details**.  

---

### **3️⃣ View SMART Data & Failure Risk**  
Once a disk is selected, the tool will display:  
✅ **Disk Model & Serial Number**  
✅ **Temperature (°C)**  
✅ **Bad Sectors Count**  
✅ **Read Errors & Disk Health Score**  
✅ **Calculated Failure Risk (0-100%)**  

⚠️ **Note:** If SMART data is unavailable, the tool will display a warning message.  

---

### **4️⃣ Run a Disk Performance Benchmark**  
- Click **“Run Benchmark”** to start the performance test.  
- The tool will measure:  
  - **Sequential Read/Write Speed (MB/s)**  
  - **Random Read/Write Performance**  
  - **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**  
- A **progress bar** will indicate benchmarking status.  

---

### **5️⃣ Analyze Benchmark Results**  
After the benchmark is completed, results will be displayed:  
✅ **Read Speed (MB/s)**  
✅ **Write Speed (MB/s)**  
✅ **Random Read/Write Performance**  
✅ **Overall Disk Performance Score**  

⚠️ **Note:** The tool **does NOT modify or damage any data**—it simply performs read/write tests in a safe environment.  

---

# **5️⃣ Restrictions & Limitations**  

### **1️⃣ Admin Privileges Required for Full Access**  
🔹 If you **do not run the tool as admin**, it will:  
❌ Restrict access to **SMART data**.  
❌ Disable **failure prediction features**.  

---

### **2️⃣ Cannot Repair or Modify Disks**  
🔹 This tool is **read-only** and **does not attempt to repair bad sectors or recover lost data**.  

---

### **3️⃣ Limited SMART Data Access**  
🔹 Some disks **block access** to SMART health details due to manufacturer settings.

# **1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction**  
The **Advanced Deep File Recovery Tool** is a powerful program that allows you to **scan for deleted files** and **recover lost data** from your hard drive. It works by searching for file **signatures** (JPG, PNG, PDF, DOCX, etc.) within the **raw disk sectors**, allowing recovery even when the **Recycle Bin has been emptied**.  

‚úÖ **Key Features:**  
- **Supports multiple file types:** JPG, PNG, PDF, DOCX, MP4, ZIP, and more.  
- **Deep disk scanning:** Finds files even after deletion.  
- **Admin Privilege Check:** Prevents unauthorized use.  
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Simple interface with drive selection, progress bar, and file list.  
- **No external dependencies:** Works without special drivers or tools.  

---

# **2Ô∏è‚É£ How It Works**  
üîç **Deleted files are not immediately removed** from the hard drive. Instead, the system marks the space as "available," meaning the data still exists **until it gets overwritten**. This tool **scans raw disk sectors** for file signatures and attempts to reconstruct the files.  

---

# **3Ô∏è‚É£ Installation & Requirements**  

## **üíª System Requirements**
- **OS:** Windows 10/11 (Admin privileges recommended for full access)  
- **RAM:** Minimum **4GB RAM** for smooth scanning  
- **Storage:** Minimum **1GB free space** for recovered files  
- **Python Version:** **Python 3.8+**  

## **üì¶ Install Required Libraries**
Before using the tool, install the required Python packages:  
```sh
pip install pyqt6 psutil tqdm
```

## **üõ†Ô∏è Running the Tool**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Download the script** and save it as `file_recovery.py`.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** or **Terminal** and navigate to the script‚Äôs location.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the program:  
```sh
python file_recovery.py
```

# **4Ô∏è‚É£ How to Use the Tool (Step-by-Step Guide)**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Application**
- **Run `file_recovery.py`**
- The program **checks for Admin Privileges** (this ensures full disk access).  
- If **no admin privileges**, the tool **disables recovery functions** (for security reasons).  

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Select the Drive to Scan**
- Use the **dropdown menu** to select a disk (`C:`, `D:`, `E:` etc.).  
- This tells the program **which drive to scan** for deleted files.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Scanning**
- Click the **"Scan for Deleted Files"** button.  
- The tool will **search raw disk sectors** for lost files based on **file signatures** (JPG, PNG, DOCX, etc.).  
- A **progress bar** will update as the scan progresses.  

‚úÖ **Scanning time depends on the drive size** (it may take a few minutes).  

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ View Deleted Files**
- Once scanning is complete, the **deleted files** will appear in the list.  
- Each entry shows **File Type & Sector** where it was found.  

üîπ **Example Output:**  
```
‚úÖ JPG found at sector 1521034
‚úÖ PDF found at sector 3210410
‚úÖ MP4 found at sector 6102341
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Recover a Deleted File**
1. Select the **file you want to recover** from the list.  
2. Click **"Recover Selected File"**.  
3. A **dialog box** will ask where to save the recovered file.  
4. Choose a **recovery folder** (preferably on another drive to avoid overwriting).  
5. Click **OK**, and the file will be restored!

# **5Ô∏è‚É£ File Recovery Process Explained**
### **How the Tool Finds Files**
- The tool scans for **unique file headers** (signatures) of different file formats.
- When a match is found, the tool **extracts the file** starting from that sector.
- The file is **saved as a new file** in the recovery folder.

### **Supported File Types & Their Signatures**
| File Type | Signature |
|-----------|-----------|
| JPG | `FF D8 FF` |
| PNG | `89 50 4E 47` |
| PDF | `%PDF` |
| DOCX/XLSX/PPTX | `PK 03 04` |
| MP4 | `00 00 00 18 66 74 79 70 6D 70 34` |
| ZIP | `PK 03 04` |
| RAR | `52 61 72 21` |
| EXE | `4D 5A` |
| MP3 | `49 44 33` |
| TXT (UTF-8) | `EF BB BF` |

# **6Ô∏è‚É£ Safety Tips & Best Practices**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Recover files ASAP before they are overwritten!**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Never recover files to the same drive you‚Äôre scanning!**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Avoid using SSDs if possible** (TRIM erases deleted files permanently).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Ensure you have enough storage** for recovered files.  

‚úÖ **Recommended:**  
‚úîÔ∏è Use an **external drive** to save recovered files.  
‚úîÔ∏è Stop using the drive **immediately after deletion** (to prevent overwriting).  
‚úîÔ∏è If a file **isn't fully recovered**, try scanning again **before saving new data**.

# **7Ô∏è‚É£ FAQs & Troubleshooting**

### **Q: Why can‚Äôt I recover some files?**
‚ùå Some files may be **overwritten** by new data and are **unrecoverable**.  

### **Q: Why is the recovered file corrupted?**
üîπ The file might be **partially overwritten**, leading to missing data.  
üîπ Some **files require metadata** (e.g., DOCX, MP4), which may be lost.  

### **Q: The tool doesn‚Äôt detect my external drive!**
üîπ Ensure the external drive is **connected properly** and **formatted correctly (NTFS/FAT)**.  
üîπ Restart the tool and **try scanning again**.  

### **Q: Why does scanning take a long time?**
üîπ Larger drives **take longer to scan**. The tool **reads every sector** for lost files.  

### **Q: Can I use this on a USB or SD card?**
‚úÖ Yes! As long as the USB/SD **has not been formatted with TRIM**.

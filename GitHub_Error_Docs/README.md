## **ðŸ›  Usage & Safety Hints**  

âœ… **Understand Before Executing:** Always **read and understand** the solution before running Git commands. Some commands (e.g., `--force` or `reset`) can **permanently alter commit history**.  

âœ… **Use `git status` Frequently:** Before running a fix, check your **current branch, pending changes, and commit status** using:  
   ```sh
   git status
   ```  

âœ… **Backup Before Major Changes:** If you are unsure, **create a backup branch** before executing commands that modify history:  
   ```sh
   git checkout -b backup-branch
   ```  

âœ… **Be Careful with Force Push (`--force`):**  
   - **Avoid using `git push --force`** unless necessary, as it can overwrite commits on the remote branch.  
   - If needed, use **`git push --force-with-lease`** instead, which ensures youâ€™re not accidentally deleting someone elseâ€™s work.  

âœ… **Use Stashing for Temporary Changes:** If you have uncommitted work but need to pull updates, use:  
   ```sh
   git stash
   git pull origin main
   git stash pop
   ```  
   This prevents merge conflicts while keeping your local changes safe.  

âœ… **Resolve Conflicts Manually When Needed:** If Git encounters **merge conflicts**, avoid blindly accepting changes. Instead:  
   - Open the conflicting files and **manually edit** them.  
   - Use `git diff` to compare versions before merging.  

âœ… **Test Before Committing to Main Branch:** If possible, test changes in a **separate branch** before merging into `main` to avoid breaking production workflows.

## **âš  Ethical & Responsible Use**  

- **These solutions are meant for resolving Git issues in a responsible manner.**  
- **Avoid destructive commands** unless absolutely necessary.  
- **If working on a team project, communicate with teammates** before running commands that modify shared history.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security and Safety Notices

1. **Review Before Running:**  
   - It is **strongly recommended** to review and understand the code **before executing** it on your system.  
   - Ensure that you are aware of what the script does to prevent any unintended actions.

2. **Run in Safe Environments:**  
   - Use a **virtual machine (VM)** or an **isolated environment** when testing unfamiliar code.  
   - This minimizes risks to your main system.

3. **Check for Dependencies:**  
   - Some scripts may require specific dependencies or libraries.  
   - Always install these from **trusted sources**.

4. **Avoid Running with Elevated Privileges:**  
   - Do not execute these scripts with **admin/root** permissions unless absolutely necessary.  
   - Running code with elevated rights can pose significant risks.

5. **Stay Updated:**  
   - Check for updates or known issues with the scripts before using them.  
   - Security patches or improvements might be available.

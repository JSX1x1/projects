## üîç **Tool Descriptions & How to Use**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Forensic Analysis Tool**  
**Description:** Extracts metadata, generates hash values (MD5, SHA-256), and provides a hex dump preview of uploaded files.  

**How to Use:**  
- Upload a file to analyze its properties.  
- View its **hex dump** and **calculate hash values**.  
- Detect **potential tampering or corruption**.  

**Use Case:** Useful for verifying **file integrity**, **detecting altered files**, and **analyzing unknown file formats**.  

**Safety Hint:** Avoid running untrusted files, as they may contain malware.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Hex Dump Analyzer**  
**Description:** Analyzes raw hexadecimal data, detects file types, converts hex to ASCII, and performs entropy analysis.  

**How to Use:**  
- Paste a **hex dump** into the input field.  
- View its **decoded ASCII representation**.  
- Analyze **entropy** to determine if the data is encrypted or compressed.  

**Use Case:** Helps forensic analysts **decode unknown file structures** and **identify encrypted content**.  

**Safety Hint:** Higher entropy values often indicate **compressed or encrypted data**.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Hash Analyzer**  
**Description:** Identifies hash algorithms based on length and format, verifies hashes, and checks for known vulnerabilities.  

**How to Use:**  
- Enter a **hash value** to determine its algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.).  
- Compare a **hash with user-input data** for integrity verification.  
- Review **security risks** associated with weak hashing algorithms.  

**Use Case:** Helps in **file verification, password security assessments, and cryptographic analysis**.  

**Safety Hint:** Avoid using **MD5 and SHA-1** for security applications, as they are vulnerable to attacks.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **MD5 Hash Resolver (Ethical)**  
**Description:** Matches an MD5 hash against common hash values and user-provided wordlists, without using brute-force techniques.  

**How to Use:**  
- Enter an **MD5 hash** and check for a match in **common passwords**.  
- Upload a **custom dictionary file** for additional testing.  

**Use Case:** Helps verify if a password or data string corresponds to a **known weak MD5 hash**.  

**Safety Hint:** This tool **does not use brute-force or illegal cracking methods** and should only be used for research purposes.  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Password Creator & Hasher**  
**Description:** Generates secure passwords and hashes them using MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.  

**How to Use:**  
- Specify **password length** and choose **complexity options**.  
- Generate a **random secure password**.  
- Hash passwords using various algorithms.  

**Use Case:** Helps **create strong, unique passwords** and evaluate **different hashing techniques**.  

**Safety Hint:** Always store passwords using **secure hashing algorithms** like **bcrypt or Argon2**.  

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Steganography Tool**  
**Description:** Hides and extracts messages in images using **LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography** and **entropy analysis**.  

**How to Use:**  
- Upload an **image** and enter a **hidden message** to embed it.  
- Extract a **hidden message** from a stego-image.  
- Perform **entropy analysis** and **LSB detection** to identify modified pixels.  

**Use Case:** Useful for **detecting hidden communication in images** and **steganography research**.  

**Safety Hint:** Steganography can be **misused for data exfiltration**‚Äîuse responsibly.  

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **File Signature Identifier**  
**Description:** Identifies the true file type using **magic numbers (file headers)** and warns about **mismatched extensions**.  

**How to Use:**  
- Upload a file to analyze its **magic byte signature**.  
- View the **first 32 bytes in hex** for forensic examination.  
- Compare the detected file type against the **declared file extension**.  

**Use Case:** Helps **detect renamed malicious files** (e.g., `malware.exe` disguised as `image.jpg`).  

**Safety Hint:** Always verify unknown files before opening them to avoid malware infections.

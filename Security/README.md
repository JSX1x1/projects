# Security Tools Collection

## Overview

Welcome to the **Security Tools Collection**! This repository contains a variety of **self-coded cybersecurity tools** designed for specific tasks in the field of cybersecurity. The tools are compact and focused, providing a specialized approach to certain security functions.

While these tools are lightweight and optimized for a single task, they may not have the comprehensive feature set of larger, well-known cybersecurity platforms. If you're looking for highly specialized or minimalistic tools for individual security tasks, this collection is for you.

## Features

- **Lightweight Tools**: Small, efficient scripts designed for one specific task each.
- **Security-Focused**: Tools related to penetration testing, network analysis, vulnerability scanning, and more.
- **Simple Usage**: Tools that are easy to run, but designed for those who understand the specifics of the security domain.

## Security & Safety Recommendations

Before running any code or security tool, follow these **important safety tips**:

- **Check the Code**: Always review the code of any tool before running it on your system or network. Make sure you understand what the code does and verify that it doesn't contain any potentially harmful operations.
  
- **Run in a Controlled Environment**: If you're unsure about the code, run it in a **sandbox** or a **virtual machine** first. This helps to ensure that it doesn't affect your main system in any negative way.
  
- **Check for Dependencies**: Some tools may require specific libraries or external dependencies. Always install dependencies from trusted sources. 

- **Avoid Running Tools on Untrusted Systems**: Do not run these tools on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use can lead to serious legal consequences.
  
- **Stay Updated**: Cybersecurity tools evolve rapidly, and so do security vulnerabilities. Make sure you are using the most recent versions of any tool, and regularly check for updates or patches.

- **Use Responsibly**: These tools are meant for ethical hacking, penetration testing with permission, or educational purposes. Misuse of these tools is strictly prohibited and could result in legal action.

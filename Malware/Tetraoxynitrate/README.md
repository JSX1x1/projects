# ‚ö† WARNING: HIGH-INTENSITY VISUAL SIMULATION ‚ö†

## üìå About This Project
This program is a **GDI-based graphical payload simulator**, designed to replicate the visual effects of certain **malicious graphical distortions**. However, it contains **NO actual malware**, and it does **NOT modify system files, directories, or cause harm to your device**.

The goal is to **simulate** various graphical corruption effects, commonly associated with **GDI malware**, while remaining **completely safe** for use. That being said, it can be very **intense** and **resource-heavy**.

## ‚ö† IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING ‚ö†
**DO NOT RUN THIS PROGRAM IF:**
- ‚ùå You are sensitive to **fast-moving visuals**, **flashing lights**, or **rapid color changes**.
- ‚ùå You suffer from **photosensitive epilepsy** or any condition triggered by **high-speed visual effects**.
- ‚ùå You do not understand how this code works and are unsure of its impact on your system.

## ‚ö† LIABILITY DISCLAIMER ‚ö†
By running this program, you acknowledge and agree that:
1. **The creator of this program is NOT responsible** for any damage, malfunction, or unintended consequences.
2. **This program does NOT modify system files**, but depending on your hardware, it may **slow down** or **crash**.
3. **This is purely a visual simulation** and does not interact with system processes beyond rendering effects.
4. **Running this on low-performance devices** may cause lag or unstable behavior. Adjust parameters if necessary.

## üî• What This Program Does
This program contains a **series of graphical payloads**, each designed to simulate a different **visual corruption effect**. These effects range from **screen glitches**, **melting distortions**, and **fake errors**, to **high-speed color flashes**.

### **üõ† Features & Effects**
- **Blackout Screen** ‚Äì Instant full-screen darkness.
- **Glitching Blue Screen** ‚Äì A distorted flashing blue screen.
- **Blurred Screen Effect** ‚Äì Takes a screenshot and applies a rapid blur.
- **Glitching White Symbols** ‚Äì White background with chaotic random symbols.
- **Bleeding Red Text** ‚Äì A creepy, bleeding effect for text like `"Your device has been terminated"`.
- **Tetraoxynitrate Rain** ‚Äì Fast-dropping text, like a corrupted Matrix effect.
- **Rainbow Flash** ‚Äì Rapid color-changing strobe effect.
- **Pixelation Effect** ‚Äì The screen pixelates in extreme velocity.
- **White Noise Effect** ‚Äì A simulated TV static screen.
- **Glitching Vertical Bars** ‚Äì Intense colorful glitching effects.
- **Invert & Spin** ‚Äì The screen inverts colors and spins with a graffiti-like trail.
- **Glitchy Meltdown** ‚Äì The screen melts downward with glitching distortions.
- **No Escape Fake Lock-Up** ‚Äì A fake system freeze with a terrifying countdown.
- **Irreversible System Error** ‚Äì A fake red error screen with the code `0xYOUAREDEAD`.

## üìå System Requirements & Performance Notes
- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, or macOS (Pygame-supported systems).
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x (Requires Pygame, NumPy, and PIL).
- **Performance Warning**: **High CPU/GPU usage** may occur due to intense visual rendering.
- **Crashes Possible**: If your system is slow, some effects may cause **lag or crashes**.
